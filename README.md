# **InteractiveMenuForm**

**Description**  
An HTML and CSS-based responsive form that allows users to submit their contact details, meal preferences, and choose a payment method. The form features a clean, intuitive design that adjusts to different screen sizes and ensures proper input validation through built-in HTML mechanisms.

## **Features**

- **Responsive Design**: The form layout adjusts based on the user's screen size, providing an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Custom Input Fields**: Users can enter personal details (name, email, phone), select meal preferences (starters, mains, desserts), choose a payment method (cash, debit card, credit card), and specify a delivery time.
- **Form Validation**: Built-in HTML validation ensures that essential fields like name, email, and phone number are completed in the correct format, with custom error messages displayed for invalid inputs.
- **Interactive Elements**: 
  - Checkbox options for selecting starters, mains, and desserts.
  - Radio buttons for choosing a payment method.
  - A newsletter opt-in option that allows users to subscribe to future offers.
- **Form Confirmation**: After submission, users are redirected to a confirmation page, showing their order and pickup details.

## **Running the Program**

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser. This file contains the main form where users can input their details and select their meal preferences.
2. Submit the form, and it will redirect to `showForm.html`, which confirms the form submission and displays a thank you message.
